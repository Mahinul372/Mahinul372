# 👋 Hi there, I'm Mahinul Haque!

🎓 **About to Graduate with a Bachelors in Computer Science**  
Currently in my final semester and ready to swap my student ID for an employee badge (or maybe just more coffee ☕).

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Skills
- Python enthusiast (I speak fluent `print("Hello, World!")`)
- Algorithms aficionado — I love to solve problems and not just my own!
- Can also Java and C++ (multilingual, just not in human languages... yet)

## 🎤 Presentation Pro
- I’m not just a coder—I’m a presenter!  
- Consistently appreciated throughout my undergrad for delivering engaging and confident presentations.  
- If you need someone to explain recursion or persuade your audience that 0-based indexing is cool, I’m your pick!

## 🏋️‍♂️ Outside the Code
- Fitness freak: You’ll find me at the gym lifting more than just my spirits!
- (Almost-)Pro footballer: Once dreamed of playing the World Cup for Bangladesh, and I played in the U-16 National Tournament. Now, my football career is mostly limited to video games and nostalgic memories.
- I still lace up my boots occasionally, but my real goal these days is a bug-free codebase.

## 😄 Fun Facts
- I believe debugging is just another form of cardio.
- My favorite algorithm? The one that finally passes all test cases.
- If you ever need someone to explain recursion or the offside rule, I’m your guy!
